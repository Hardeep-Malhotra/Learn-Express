Express.js res.sendFile() Function

Parameter

path: The absolute or relative path to the file you want to send.
options: (Optional) An object where you can configure settings such as headers or caching.
fn: (Optional) A callback function that handles errors, typically invoked with an error object if the file cannot be sent.

Use Cases for res.sendFile()
Serving Static Files: res.sendFile() is ideal for serving static files such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and media files like images or videos directly from your server to the client.
File Downloads: You can use this method to allow users to download files. For example, serving PDF reports, downloadable documentation, or software packages.
Serving Templates: If you are serving HTML templates (e.g., EJS files) directly to the client, you can use res.sendFile() for static content like static HTML pages or as a fallback when templates are not rendered dynamically.
