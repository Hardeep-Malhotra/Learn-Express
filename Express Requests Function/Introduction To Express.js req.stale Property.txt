📌 Express.js req.stale Summary
- Definition:
req.stale is a boolean property in Express.js that indicates whether the incoming request is stale.
- Relation to req.fresh:
It is the opposite of req.fresh.
- If req.fresh is true, the client’s cache is valid.
- If req.stale is true, the client’s cache is outdated.
- Syntax:
req.stale
- No parameters.
- Returns true or false.
- How it works:
- Express checks HTTP caching headers like If-None-Match and If-Modified-Since.
- Based on these headers, it decides whether the client’s cached resource is fresh or stale.
- Return Value:
- true → The request is stale (server should send new data).
- false → The request is fresh (client can use cached data).
- Use Case:
Helps optimize performance by avoiding unnecessary data transfer. If the request is fresh, you can skip sending the full response.
