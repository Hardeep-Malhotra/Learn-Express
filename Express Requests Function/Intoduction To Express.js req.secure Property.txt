Express.js req.secure Property
The req.secure property is a Boolean property that is true if a TLS connection is established else returns false. 

Syntax:

req.secure
Return Value: It returns a Boolean value either True or False. 

🌐 What is TLS (often confused as “TLC”)?
 Actually the correct term is TLS (Transport Layer Security).
- TLS is the cryptographic protocol that secures communication over the internet.
- It’s the successor to SSL (Secure Sockets Layer).
- When you use HTTPS (https://), your browser and server communicate using TLS.
- TLS provides:
- Encryption → data is scrambled so attackers can’t read it.
- Authentication → ensures you’re talking to the real server (via certificates).
- Integrity → prevents data from being modified in transit.

🔎 How req.secure works with TLS
- If your Express app is running directly with HTTPS (using https.createServer), req.secure will be true.
- If your app is behind a proxy (like Nginx or Heroku), you must enable:
app.enable('trust proxy');


- so Express trusts the proxy’s X-Forwarded-Proto header. Then req.secure will correctly reflect whether the original client used HTTPS.
✅ Summary- req.secure → tells you if the request is HTTPS.
- TLS → the protocol that makes HTTPS secure (encryption + authentication).
- Without TLS, data travels in plain text (HTTP), which is insecure.
