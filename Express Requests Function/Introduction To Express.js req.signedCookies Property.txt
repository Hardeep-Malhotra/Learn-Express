🍪 What are Signed Cookies?
- Normally, cookies are just plain text values stored in the browser and sent back to the server.
- A signed cookie is a cookie that has been cryptographically signed using a secret key.
- This prevents tampering: if someone changes the cookie value in the browser, the signature won’t match and Express will reject it.

🔎 req.signedCookies Property
- When you use the cookie-parser middleware with a secret key, Express automatically verifies signed cookies.
- req.signedCookies contains all the cookies that were signed and successfully verified.
- These cookies are returned as a plain JavaScript object, ready to use.
