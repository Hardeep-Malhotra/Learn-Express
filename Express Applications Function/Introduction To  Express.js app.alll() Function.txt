Express.js | app.all() Function

The app.all() function is used to route all types of HTTP requests. Like if we have POST, GET, PUT, DELETE, etc, requests made to any specific route, let's say /user, so instead of defining different APIs like app.post('/user'), app.get('/user'), etc, we can define single API app.all('/user') which will accept all type of HTTP request. 

Syntax:

app.all( path, callback )
Parameters:

Path: It is the path for which the middleware function is called.
Callback: It can be a middleware function or a series/array of functions.
