Route parameters in Express.js are dynamic URL segments defined with a colon (:) and accessed via req.params, enabling efficient handling of variable data such as IDs in RESTful routes.

Syntax:

app.get('/users/:id', (req, res) => {
  const userId = req.params.id;
  res.send(`User ID is: ${userId}`);
});
In the above syntax:

:id: defines the route parameter.
req.params.id: retrieves the value from the URL.
Here are the different ways to handle route parameters in Express.js include basic, optional, and multiple parameters.
