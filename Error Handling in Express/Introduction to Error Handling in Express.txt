Error Handling in Express
Last Updated : 19 Sep, 2025
Error handling in Express refers to the process of managing errors that occur during the execution of a request. When an error occurs in a route or middleware, Express provides mechanisms to catch these errors and prevent the application from crashing. Error-handling middleware allows developers to:

Log errors for debugging.
Send structured error responses to users.
Maintain application stability even when issues arise.
Good error handling makes an application more reliable and user-friendly, improving both developer efficiency and the user experience.

How Error Handling Works
Express ensures errors are caught and managed effectively to prevent application crashes.

Error Detection: Automatically detects issues, such as bad requests or server failures.
Error-Handling Middleware: Uses special middleware to catch and process errors in a structured way.
Passing Errors: Errors in routes are passed to the middleware using next(err).
Logging: Errors are logged to help developers quickly identify and resolve issues.
User-Friendly Responses: Express sends clear, non-technical messages to users instead of showing stack traces.
